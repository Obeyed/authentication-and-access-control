Authentication Lab
==================

This assignment was giving at a Data Security course in Autumn 2014 at the Technical University of Denmark.
 
It is an interesting assignment about authentication of passwords, secure connections, symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.
I have had no experience with hands on encryption, so my solution is a big buggy. 

I might get back to it in the future and try to fix it, if not for the next assignments for this course.

If anyone tries to download and play with this, be aware of exceptions. This is not a functioning implementation.
Also, you might need to download "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files" for your version of JDK.
